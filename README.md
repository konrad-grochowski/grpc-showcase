# grpc-experiment
This project showcases potential strengths of gRPC framework.
## Aim
- Create service `grpc-store`, which stores key-value pairs in memory, and handles storing and loading requests through a gRPC service;
- Create HTTP proxy server `rest-api`, which takes requests to store/load key-value pairs, forwards the requests through gRPC and returns responses to the HTTP client.
## Project components overview
### Services
The following services can be made into Dockercontainers, using the Dockerfiles inside respective directories.
(Note: containers need to be built with root dir context.)
### grpc-store
Contains source code for the `rest-api` HTTP server.
### rest-api
Contains source code for the `grpc-store` in-memory storage, with a gRPC server.
## Utilities
### grpc-codegen
Contains Rust library with gRPC related code, generated by `tonic-build` dependency.
The generated code creates gRPC client and server implementations, data models and service traits, all of these being mirrored
by a provided `proto` file, also available in the directory.
This is a dependency to both of the above services.
